				<h3>premier dermatology</h3><br>
					<p>Premier Dermatology approached the agency I was working at with a problem. They were facing increased competition from "medi-spas", which were commonly opened by doctors as a way to make more money on the side by performing electing dermatological procedures. The problem was that, while technically legal for anyone with an MD to do this, the doctors were often not board certified dermatologists.</p><p>This campaign was created with Photographer Tony D'Orio to make a simple point: You wouldn't want uncertified people involved in other parts of your life, why something as serious as dermatology?</p>
