				<h3>in love with the struggle</h3><br>
					<p>This was a self initiated typographic project created from a few words I first heard in Tupac's "Me and my Girlfriend". To me it's more than a throwaway line, it sort of defines an approach to design and to life that I think we need to have in order to succeed. Work is tough. Life is tough. You have to learn to not only roll with the punches but be able to stand up and say 'thank you sir may I have another'. You have to fall in love with the struggle in order to appreciate the lessons learned with each setback.</p>

				<p>The header area needed to accomodate several featured items or events, but we were careful to preserve hierarchy and always let the top item stand out visually. We created an area directly beneath the full-width image dedicated to secondary topics and an overview of the President's stance on major issues, then dedicated the sidebar to quick donation, social sharing and a host of ways to get involved. Below that, a cascade of recent stories presented further opportunities to get informed and share news.</p>

				<p>The sidebar stayed fixed as users scrolled through the blog items, making it easy to get involved without having to scroll back to the top.</p>

				<p>For major events like the convention, we were able to execute page takeovers in hours thanks to an always-on frontend development team.</p>

				<p>Templates had to accomodate different locations, dates and times while staying true to a similar look and feel.
