					<p>Enso is one of my favorite experiences as a designer. I thought I had it all figured out. I spent months working their case studies, mission statement and identity into a tidy, responsive package. It was clean. Contemporary. Entirely adquate and even signed-off on; but I absolutely hated it.</p><p>So I started over.</p><p>Throwing out every single asset and starting from scratch enabled me to approach the project with fresh vision, informed by the mistakes and content realities gleaned in the previous round. I wanted something fun and serendipitous, while at the same time lightweight and readable on any device, at any viewport width.</p>

				<p>An easter egg on the homepage allowed users to change the color palette to a darker CSS theme by clicking the lightbulb icon in the upper left.</p>

				<p>Making the Team page was a lot of fun, and a project in itself. Over the course of a week we had each employee wake up early and come out to the beach. Predictably, some of the best facial expressions came when the icy water ran over our feet.</p>

				<p>Case studies were displayed large and clean on a white background. Minimal navigation made it easy to get from one case study to the next, or to simply go back home by clicking the logo.</p>

				<p>The launch of helloenso.com was a big success, featured on awwwards, httpster, css awards and other web design curations as well as design blogs like designspiration.net. In sum, the buzz around the site led to a 164% increase in traffic compared to the month previous. You can visit the site by clicking <a href="http://helloenso.com">here</a></p>
