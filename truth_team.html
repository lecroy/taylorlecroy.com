					<p>During the President's '08 campaign, they created and maintained a website called Fight the Smears, which had the sole purpose of collecting and clearing the air about various attacks and attempts to discredit his record and personal history.</p><p>In 2012, we found there was still a need for something similar, but wanted to take it a step further. The result was Truth Team, a group of three websites linked with a common, centralized dropdown menu. They were "AttackWatch", which addressed things like the birth certificate, "KeepingHisWord", which highlighted instances where Obama said he'd do something and folowed through; and "KeepingGOPHonest", which rebutted the more current attacks coming from the right.</p><p>There was a very conscious decision to keep these neutral, newsy and without any clear visual biases.</p>
